# NationalsWebEntry
The web entry system for the National Scout Rifle Championships.

If you want to develop and deploy this system you will need an admin to give you permissions. For admins, this is [the process to follow](./help/Set%20Up%20New%20User.md).

## Create a Cloud9 IDE

Once you have been given permissons you'll be able to log in to the [HSRC AWS Console](https://hsrc.signin.aws.amazon.com/console). From there you can create a Cloud9 IDE to use and deploy the code.

Log in to [AWS Console](https://hsrc.signin.aws.amazon.com/console).

In the AWS navigation bar choose 'Services', then 'Cloud9'. Then select 'Create Environment'. Give the environment a name then press 'Next Step'. Leave all the default settings and create the environment.
