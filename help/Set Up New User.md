# Set Up A New HSRC AWS User

In the [AWS Console](https://hsrc.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/) navigation bar choose 'Services', then 'IAM'. 

Select 'Users' on the left, then 'Add User'.

Give them a user name. We are following the pattern of lower case first name and last name with no space inbetween, e.g. jamesbond.

Select both 'Programmatic access' and 'AWS Management Console access'. Leave the defaults of an autogenerated password with required change, then press 'Next'.

Select the relevant groups, at least 'ScoutNationalsUsers'. Press 'Next' until you create the user.

Once the user has been created press 'Download .csv' to save their details, then share them with the user.
